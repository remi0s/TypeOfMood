1)Find an language dump file from https://archive.org/ or http://opus.nlpl.eu/OpenSubtitles2018.php or http://opus.nlpl.eu/index.php

2)Edit sort.sh to match the file downloaded. For tar.gz files use "zcat", for bz2 use "bzcat" else try "cat". And run it with ./sort.sh (running this command will take LONG if the file size is big)

3)After the wordlist is created use the parser.pl with command perl parser.pl filename > newfilename

4)Spellchecking the wordlist is essential. There are many ways to do it but i would recommend using a python script because its less time consuming. 

5)Add header information in the new wordlist file

6)Edit run.sh file to fit the filenames and then use it with ./run.sh command to create the binary dictionary

Have Fun!
